# Green eggs and IAM
Welcome to my silly little series where I explore IAM concepts through the lens of beloved Childrens book titles.

Im a security engineer who primarily focuses on Identity and access management. Journey with me as I follow my child like wonder through the process of practicing securing tried and true tools like Active Directory, while mixing in new fresh cloud tools like Microsoft Entra and Okta

## 🎯 The big "Why?"

Its always important to reflect on your individual motivations outside of survival and maintenance. I find myself in this moment asking "what's my why?" and Ive come to realize that the answer is quiet simple on the outside looking in. 

I love to learn!

I could say I love knowledge for the sake of knowing but that not it. I genuinely hope that by making this public to the masses I can do at least one of the following:

- teach
- inspire
- demonstrate

I want to teach others the concepts that interest me in an easily digestabe and clear format. I want to motivate other not only try IAM but to as the beloved Magic school Bus Teacher always said "Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!"
